# Codebase stewardship planning tasks repository

This is an issue-only repository containing the [issues](https://github.com/publiccodenet/codebasestewards/issues) codebase stewards are actively working on.
These issues together with codebase specific issues can be found on our [weekly planning board](https://github.com/publiccodenet/codebasestewards/projects/1)

We invite everyone to [create issues](https://github.com/publiccodenet/codebasestewards/issues/new) you think are important for codebase stewards to pick up. In our weekly planning sessions we will determine on which of those tasks we will work.

For more information about codebase stewardship please visit our [website](https://publiccode.net/codebase-stewardship/) or [codebase steward wiki](https://github.com/publiccodenet/codebasestewards/wiki)
